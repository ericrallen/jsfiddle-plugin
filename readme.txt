Users can link their Wordpress account to JSFiddle and insert their fiddles via a shortcode. It supports custom skins for JSFiddle embeds.

== Description ==

Adds a custom user contact method for JSFiddle, or if a developer has already added a custom contact method for JSFiddle, they can define that field for use as the JSFiddle username instead.

Adds a custom meta box to the post and page editing pages with a user's fiddles (pulled in via the JSFiddle API), and allows the user to define some custom options for their embedded Fiddle (tabs,width,height,etc.).

It also supports custom JSFiddle skins that users can add to a directory. They can specify the directory to be used or use the skins directory provided by the plug-in.
