Stable tag: 1.3.2

Users can link their Wordpress account to JSFiddle and insert their fiddles via a shortcode. It supports custom skins for JSFiddle embeds.

== Description ==

Adds a custom user contact method for JSFiddle, or if a developer has already added a custom contact method for JSFiddle, they can define that field for use as the JSFiddle username instead.

Adds a custom meta box to the post and page editing pages with a user's fiddles (pulled in via the JSFiddle API), and allows the user to define some custom options for their embedded Fiddle (tabs,width,height,etc.).

It also supports custom JSFiddle skins that users can add to a directory. They can specify the directory to be used or use the skins directory provided by the plug-in.

== Installation ==

If you are upgrading from 1.0 or v1.0b (before I understood the WP Repo version tagging), you will have to reset your options because the deactivation process was incorrectly set up. All future versions will maintain your options. I apologize for the inconvenience.

1. Upload `jsfiddle-shortcode-w-custom-skins` to your plug-in directory or install it from the Wordpress Plug-in Repository
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add your JSFiddle username to the contact method field for JSFiddle, or open JSFiddle Shortcode Settings from the Settings menu and define your previously added JSFiddle user contact method field
4. Begin adding JSFiddles to your posts and pages using the metabox
5. Add custom skins to the `/jsfiddle-shortcode-w-custom-skins/jsFiddle-skin-proxy/skins/` directory or open JSFiddle Shortcode Settings and define your custom skin directory there
6. Add the following code block to your functions.php to allow JSFiddles in your comments:
	`function init_comment_shortcodes() {
		remove_all_shortcodes();
		add_shortcode('iajsfiddle', 'ia_jsfiddle_display_by_shortcode');
		add_filter('comment_text', 'do_shortcode');
	}
	add_filter('comments_template', 'init_comment_shortcodes');`

= 1.1 =
Fixed a few issues with the plug-in in the Add Post and Edit and Add Page sections. Also, fixed deactivation so that it doesn't clear all your options. You may have to reset them after you upgrade, but this won't happen in the future.
