jsfiddle-plugin
===============

Adds [jsfiddle] shortcode to Wordpress.

This plug-in is in its super-beta phase, I haven't tested it yet, just wanted to get it started.

Eventually it will allow you to set up a per-user JSFiddle username and then just supply the hash that JSFiddle includes in it's URL along with some options to specify what to show/hide.

It is a work in progress.
