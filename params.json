{"body":"###What does it do?\r\nAdds a custom user contact method for JSFiddle, or if a developer has already added a custom contact method for JSFiddle, they can define that field for use as the JSFiddle username instead.\r\n\r\nAdds a custom meta box to the post and page editing pages with a user's fiddles (pulled in via the JSFiddle API), and allows the user to define some custom options for their embedded Fiddle (tabs,width,height,etc.).\r\n\r\nIt also supports custom JSFiddle skins that users can add to a directory. They can specify the directory to be used or use the skins directory provided by the plug-in.\r\n\r\nThe plug-in has a theme manager file and class that can be run via the Wordpress cron function (or set up as a regular cronjob by developers) and retrieves all current skins in the defined skins directory and uses them to populate the Skin dropdown in the shortcode generating metabox.\r\n\r\n###Why?\r\nI wanted to be able to easily embed JSFiddles in a site I'm working on, and wanted to be able to have the embedded fiddle match my site's design scheme. (not that there is anything wrong with the default JSFiddle skin)\r\n\r\nI figured other people might like to do this, too.\r\n\r\n###Installation\r\n1. Upload `jsfiddle-shortcode-w-custom-skins` to your plug-in directory or [http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jsfiddle-shortcode-w-custom-skins/](download) and install it from the Wordpress Plug-in Repository\r\n2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress\r\n3. Add your JSFiddle username to the contact method field for JSFiddle, or open JSFiddle Shortcode Settings from the Settings menu and define your previously added JSFiddle user contact method field\r\n4. Begin adding JSFiddles to your posts and pages using the metabox\r\n5. Add custom skins to the `/jsfiddle-shortcode-w-custom-skins/jsFiddle-skin-proxy/skins/` directory or open JSFiddle Shortcode Settings and define your custom skin directory there\r\n6. Add the following code block to your functions.php to allow JSFiddles in your comments:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nfunction init_comment_shortcodes() {\r\n        //prevent the use of other shortcodes\r\n        remove_all_shortcodes();\r\n        add_shortcode('iajsfiddle', 'ia_jsfiddle_display_by_shortcode');\r\n        add_filter('comment_text', 'do_shortcode');\r\n}\r\nadd_filter('comments_template', 'init_comment_shortcodes');\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Coming Soon\r\n* Internationalization\r\n* Multi-Site compatibility","tagline":"Adds [iajsfiddle] shortcode to Wordpress w/ custom skin functionality","google":"UA-34389806-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
